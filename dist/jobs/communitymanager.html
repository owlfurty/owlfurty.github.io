							<!-- Job Description -->

				      <p class="intro">
					      Mayfield Robotics is a startup working on creating an adorable home robot. Our team is small and growing quickly. We are wholly owned by a large company, but are operating independently. It is like a typical startup in terms of speed and growth but without the distraction of fundraising. The atmosphere around the office is energetic, casual, and nerdy. We like to build robots and stay close to our customers. We recently moved offices and are located in Redwood City right off 101 and a short walk from Caltrain.
							</p>

							<h4>The Role</h4>

							<p>
							  We’re looking for a Community Manager who likes robots and has a sense of humor to create, foster, and manage our online presence as we prepare to launch our adorable home robot.
							</p>

							<p>
								Currently, Mayfield and our robot are unknown to press and partners as well as to potential customers and employees. Your job is to help change that. We need our Twitter, Facebook, and other social media accounts either engaged and/or created, then populated with content. Some of that content will be sneak peeks into what we’re making (and how we’re making it) and other will be&hellip; well, whatever you think it should be, and probably news from the robotics/tech world.
							</p>

							<p>
								As our robots make their way out into the world, first to testers, then to the general public, you’ll respond and help steer them to the right place with information and help if they reach out via social media.
							</p>

							<p>
								Since you’ll be reporting to a guy who’s written a few books, you’ll need to be an excellent writer. You’ll help create the written tone for our online presence, which will be funny, helpful, informative, and humble. You’ll craft the story of the company and our products and help deliver that across many different mediums, from blog posts to podcasts to photos and videos.
							</p>
