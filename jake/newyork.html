            <p>During the summer of 2014, I was lucky enough to land an internship in New York City. Since it was my very first time in the busy metropolis, and a completely new experience for me, I wanted to document my journey to share back with my with friends and family. As I started to ideate I thought to the standard Tumblr or Wordpress blog experience and realized that in all of the travel blogs my friends have made, I have never spent more than 5 minutes reading them. With that thought I set out to sum up my summer journey into a 5 minute experience.</p>

                <a href="http://johnjacob.ca/newyork/" target="_blank">Link to live website <span>&#8594;</span></a>
            </p>

            <p>In the end the site did far better than I was expecting. Instead of sharing my experience with just my friends and family, I was able to share it with the 10,000 visitors I had within the first month. The company I was interning at also gave me the opportunity to write an article about my process on <a href="https://labs.ideo.com/2014/11/05/building-a-better-blog/">“IDEO Labs”</a>, their tech focused blog, that goes over the design and development that went into the project.</p>
